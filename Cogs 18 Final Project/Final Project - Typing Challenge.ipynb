    "I used the time module in order to have the program print out text with a delay between messages, and the threading module to add a timer for the challenge. I made a function for each difficulty, as well as a specific time-running-out function to be called in each difficulty function. Finally, I made a function for the user to choose their difficulty and a function that introduces the challenge and is used to start the code."
